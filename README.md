# improved-network-for-UAV-scene-object-detection

**Dataset:** This paper employs the VisDrone2019 dataset for model training and evaluation. The dataset is collected by the AISKYEYE team at Tianjin University's Machine Learning and Data Mining Laboratory.

A training result according to the improved network structure is saved in  **source code\runs\train\improved_VisDrone\\**


Sample images of detection effects before and after model improvement are saved in **Compare sample images\\**
